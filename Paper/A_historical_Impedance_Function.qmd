**A historical collection of impedance functions for active travel accessibility analysis in Canada**

## Abstract

## Active transport accessibility has grown in importance to inform

urban planning as cities strive to become more sustainable. Accessibility analysis employs different methods such as gravity-based models, potential models, etc. An important component of these methods is the impedance function used to represent the responses of travelers to the friction of distance separating origins and destinations. The objective of this study is to investigate active travel behavior in Canada using time use data. Empirical estimates of impedance functions are calibrated to assess the time-willingness to reach different destinations such as work, school, grocery stores, restaurants, and sports places by walking and cycling. This research makes use of Canada's General Social Survey Cycles 2, 7, 12, 19, 24, 29 thus giving a historical perspective on active mobility over the past 35 years. The focus of these surveys is on time use and the datasets contain information on travel time by active modes (cycling and walking) as well as the type of activity at the end of the trip which allows us to classify trips by purpose. Our focus is on Canadian Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) and the results indicate that the most common destinations for walking trips after work or school are grocery stores, other stores or malls are the most destinations for walking travels respectively. For trips by bicycle the most common destination after traveling to work or school, is sports centers, field or arena. Strong distance-decay effects are evident from the results. The impedance functions, in addition to providing information about the behavior of active travelers in Canada for the period of time under study, are a valuable resource for implementing active accessibility analysis in Canadian applications.

## Introduction 

One of the current interests in urban and transportation planning is the notion that cities can and should be modified to influence travel behavior.Accessibility is an important factor in shaping travel behavior. Indeed, increases in density, activity mix, accessibility, and well-connected transportation infrastructure at various locations are meant to encourage more use of public transportation and active modes of transportation[@iacono2008access].Walking and cycling accessibility are frequently confused, and the combination of the two is sometimes referred to as "active accessibility" or "non-motorized accessibility"[@frank2001built; @sallis2004active; @wu2019measuring].

A substantial body of literature has contributed to quantifying urban accessibility over the last few decades.The analysis of accessibility levels of active modes of transportation in general, and the study of impedance function for calculating accessibility in particular, has become a sensitive topic and important direction of research which has recently attracted a lot of attention among researchers in transport planning, urban geography, and sustainable development [@nassir2016utility; @currie2010quantifying;@frank2005linking;@iacono2010;@krizek2005perspectives]. The majority of these approaches have agreed on two main components for measuring accessibility [@hansen1959accessibility; @pirie1979measuring; @handy1997measuring;@geurs2001accessibility; @bhat2002development; @church2003measuring; @kwan2003recent;@geurs2004; @levinson2005access; @cascetta2013new]. These two elements are as follows: (1) location and attractiveness of urban opportunities (benefit side); and, (2) impedance of travelling to these locations from residential areas in the network (cost side). Based on these definitions, more accessible areas are the ones that have lower impedance to traveling to attractive locations.


The impedance function, in its various forms, represents the willingness to cover the distance to reach those destinations and is a simple tool for analyzing the spatial distribution of travel behavior [@fotheringham1981spatial; @eldridge1991warped;@vale2017influence;@papa2012gravity; @vale2016active]. Specifically, the longer the distance to the destination, the less likely people are to walk or cycle there. Distance decay functions have been used to describe the distribution of walking and cycling as a function of distance for general walking and cycling trips and for specific purposes [@iacono2010; @larsen2010beyond; @iacono2008access]. As the impedance function in evaluating accessibility, several cost decay functions have been used such as threshold functions (e.g., step function) and smooth cost decay functions (e.g., inverse-potential, log-normal, loglogistic, exponential square-root and half-life function) [@de2009exponential;@reggiani2011accessibility; @osth2016new; @itf2017linking]. The same researchers emphasized the importance of selecting an appropriate impedance function, and it can be seen that a wide range of functions are used.Distance-decay functions with a negative exponential form are commonly used in non-motorized accessibility to express how willing people are to walk or cycle to destinations [@handy1997measuring;@geurs2001accessibility; @iacono2010;@vega2012using]. recently Vale and Pereira (2017)conducted a study and figured out that the modified Gaussian and exponential functions were the most robust for modeling walking accessibility in a study that tested 20 pedestrian accessibility measures. Furthermore, the authors presented a new cumulative Gaussian function that employs the cumulative opportunities approach at close distances of 200 or 400 m, as well as a second part of a modified Gaussian curve for longer distances. Prins et al. (2014) investigated bicycle and walking accessibility to grocery stores or markets for the elderly, estimating parameters for distance decay models based on gender, age, and functional limitations.Iacono et al. (2010) calibrated the distance-decay model for five different types of trip "purposes" (work, shopping, school, restaurant, and recreation) and created an accessibility measure for both walking and bicycling.

In addition to selecting an impedance function form, the analyst must specify which variable is used to measure separation or impedance (time, cost or both). Both measures have been used in practice, as have some examples of the use of the generalized cost concept [@handy1997measuring;@iacono2010;@yang2012walking; @arranz2019measuring ]. According to previous research, using either time or distance as an impedance variable is acceptable.However, due to the difficulties associated with extracting accurate travel times from existing network models for bicycling and walking, the options for non-motorized travel appear to be limited to the use of distance [@handy1997measuring].

This study aims to generate a historical evidence of people's actual travel behavior, particularly with regard to active modes of transportation from 1986 to 2015 in Canada. Travel behavior is investigated for a variety of trip purposes (including Home, work or school, other's home, outdoors, business,  shopping, Library, museum or theater, restaurant,and Place of worship.) to understand individuals’ willingness to reach their destinations. The method that has been used to understand people's willingness to travel is the impedance functions. Although walking and cycling have some similarities, they also have significant differences [@tan2014walking; @demaio2009bike]. Both are human-powered modes that necessitate certain physical abilities. Cycling, on the other hand, has a faster travel speed and a greater range of distance than walking. Walking, on the other hand, is more adaptable than cycling and does not require any special equipment. Previous research has frequently overlooked the fact that walking and cycling opportunities may compete when both are available for short trips. As a result, people can choose one mode of transportation over another based on their willingness and cost. Therefore, the goal of this article is to calculate the impedance function separately for cycling and walking trips using General Social Survey (GSS) data set in Canada.





To calculate impedance values for each mode and trip purpose, household travel survey data were used to fit a negative exponential curve that provided a continuous approximation to the shape of the trip length distribution, using both trip duration and distance data. The same functional form was used for all impedances to ensure consistency of application across modes and trip purposes


(Iacono et al., 2010)
Such issues often result in analysts borrowing assumptions from analysis designed for other purposes. A common example is an analysis borrowing impedance values from a locally-calibrated travel model. The values extracted from these data may be sensitive
to the environment in which they were collected; particularly for non-motorized behavior, issues related to weather conditions play a big role. Ideally, travel survey data would be collected year round and cover all seasons (Ortuzar and Willumsen, 2001). More commonly, data are collected over a period of several months and reflect weather conditions prevailing at the time the survey data were collected. This is especially important in the case of nonmotorized modes and in locations where significant seasonal climate variations exist. For example, if survey data are collected during warmer, drier months it is possible that changes in travel behavior during colder or wetter months might be missed. These changes might include mode shifts, in which case the number of pedestrians and bicyclists might be overestimated during cold weather periods, and changes in destination choice for discretionary trips, which would affect the length or distance of travel, and hence the relevant impedance values.

Estimating specialized impedance functions specific to nonmotorized modes requires appropriate travel survey data that can capture pedestrian and bicycling behavior. Ideally, this would involve a focused, special-purpose survey designed to oversample these types of behavior or data collected from Global Positioning Systems – a relatively costly alternative. In the absence of such data, a regional household travel survey can be used to the extent that it
specifically includes trips by non-motorized modes. The current study employed household survey data collected in 2000 for the Minneapolis-St. Paul region. A limitation of this approach, however, is the variety of destinations that can feasibly be studied. Given that walking and bicycling tend to be less heavily-used and often underreported modes in many US cities, any further partitioning of the data can lead to small samples and less robust inferences



Since the full specification of the gravity model is not applicable for forecasting the distribution of trips by non-motorized modes over a large area, some modifications must be made. One option is to estimate impedance directly from the frequency distribution of trip lengths. While this approach is feasible, it has some serious limitations. Estimating an impedance parameter in the absence of information about the spatial distribution of activities (as is provided in the gravity model) is equivalent to assuming that activities are evenly distributed in space (Sheppard, 1995). Clearly this assumption is not reasonable for most metropolitan regions and
can lead to biased results.

A second caveat relates to the functional form of the impedance function. While many different specifications of the impedance function have been used, there is little available evidence to suggest a priori which one might be superior. Most of the specifications differ in their treatment of the effects of distance, which would in turn affect accessibility measurement. Here, we choose the negative exponential form (e_bx). This function has the advantage that it declines more gradually than the power function, and thus better estimates shorter trips, such as those made by nonmotorized modes (Kanafani, 1983). This advantage, along with a
record of numerous empirical applications made it an appropriate functional form to be estimated for the set of impedance functions applied in the current study.





The impedance function plays a particularly important role in the study of nonwork accessibility, because nonwork travel involves a wide range of trip purposes and travelers
behave differently depending on the purpose of their trip. Theories of urban form such as Christaller’s (1933=1966) central place theory have long recognized that a person’s willingness to travel long distances varies by the purpose of a trip. Central place theory explains urban form as a hierarchy of places determined in part by a desire of consumers to minimize travel to purchase goods and services (Lo¨sch 1954; O’Sullivan 2000). Different business types have different trade areas. People tend to buy certain goods and services for the convenience of not traveling far—typically near home or work—such as groceries, gasoline, or hair salons.
Conversely, people tend to travel farther for other kinds of goods and services for which convenience is less important than the ability to make comparisons before a purchase,
such as furniture, household appliances, or a car. To illustrate, people could easily spend 45 minutes of travel time to purchase a new couch but rarely spend more than about 10 minutes to pick up a carton of milk. Travelers who set out to buy milk feel a greater ‘‘friction’’ compared to going to a furniture store because most people have many milk-selling destinations closer to home than furniture stores, and because the value they derive from buying milk is far lower
than for making a major purchase like a couch. So the impedance function must be calculated separately for each trip purpose. I calculated impedance functions by using automobile trips from the 2005 household travel survey referenced above (Michigan Department of Transportation, 2005). I used a single, automobile-based impedance function for both modes, in part because the set of transit trips are too small for a reliable estimate, but also because automobile travel more accurately reflects the ‘‘norm’’ of expectations from travelers throughout the region. This assumption is likely to marginally understate the disadvantage experienced by racial and ethnic minorities because they disproportionately constitute transit riders.





Despite the growth of research on the social and physical environmental features that may be associated with walking, there is little evidence on the amounts and durations of usual walking trips for different purposes among nationally representative samples of U.S. residents 12,19
