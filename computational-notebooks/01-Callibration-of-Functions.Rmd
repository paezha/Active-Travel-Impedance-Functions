# Callibration of functions

In this notebook we take the data that was processed in notebook `00-Reading-Source-Files.Rmd` and use them to callibrate impedance functions.

## Preliminaries

Load packages:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(here)
```

Read data files:
```{r}
load(file = paste0(here(),"/data/m_2015_slice.rda"))
```

Happily analyze data:
```{r}
summary(m_2015_slice$SEX)
```
