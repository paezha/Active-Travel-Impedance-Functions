## Reading Source Files

In this notebook I experiment with reading the files and then saving them to an R native format for ease of use.

Begin by loading the packages used in this notebook: 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(readxl)
library(usethis)
```

Read a file as an example:
```{r}
m_2015 <- read_excel(paste0(here(), "/data-inputs/source-files/Time use_2015/gss-m.xlsx"))
```

Process data as an example:
```{r}
m_2015_slice <- m_2015 |>
  slice_head(n = 10)
```

Save data for later use:
```{r}
save(m_2015_slice,
     file = paste0(here(), "/data/m_2015_slice.rda"))
```
